# Internship Weekly Report - Week 6

**Name:** Sandeep Ravaji Patel
**Domain:** Data Science
**Week Number:** Week 6

## Objective

To understand clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically focusing on implementing K-Means clustering and performing PCA using Scikit-Learn.

## Tasks Completed

* Learned about unsupervised learning and its applications.
* Understood the concept of clustering and the K-Means algorithm.
* Implemented K-Means clustering using Scikit-Learn's `KMeans` class.
* Learned about dimensionality reduction and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
* Performed PCA using Scikit-Learn's `PCA` class to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset.
* Visualized clusters and the results of PCA.
* Evaluated the performance of K-Means clustering.

## Tools Used

* Scikit-Learn
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

## Challenges Faced

* **Understanding the mathematical concepts behind PCA:**
    * Initially found it challenging to grasp the concepts of eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and variance explained.
    * **Resolution:** Reviewed linear algebra concepts and PCA tutorials, and experimented with different datasets to visualize the effects of PCA.
* **Choosing the optimal number of clusters for K-Means:**
    * Was unsure about how to determine the best value for 'k' in K-Means clustering.
    * **Resolution:** Implemented the elbow method to identify the optimal 'k' by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares for different values of 'k' and selecting the 'k' at the "elbow" point.

## Learning Outcome

* Developed a solid understanding of unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering and dimensionality reduction.
* Implemented K-Means clustering and PCA using Scikit-Learn.
* Gained experience in applying these techniques to real-world datasets.
* Improved ability to analyze and interpret the results of clustering and dimensionality reduction.
* Learned how to visualize clusters and the effects of PCA.
